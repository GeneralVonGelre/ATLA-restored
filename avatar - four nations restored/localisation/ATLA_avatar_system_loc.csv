AVATAR_TITLE_FOA;Most Esteemed Avatar;;;;;;;;;;;;x

NAE.005.T;Death of the Avatar;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.005.D1;The Sages have gathered to proclaim something shocking: the Avatar is dead. Though they were young, not having seen even their 20th year, already their time upon the world has come to a close. As surely as the sun sets on each day, so too must the sun set on each incarnation of the Avatar - unfortunately, night must sometimes fall far earlier than expected.\n\nIt falls upon all four of the nations now to preserve their harmony in the absence of the Avatar, lest those who seek to upset balance seize the oppurtunity presented while the world is without its defender.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.005.D2;The Sages have proclaimed it: the Avatar is dead. This is a time of sadness and morning for many, both close to the Avatar and otherwise - it is not, however, a time totally devoid of hope. Already, a new reincarnation walks the world. Just as the sun will set, only to rise again, so too must the cycle of the Avatar continue.\n\nIt falls upon all four of the nations now to preserve their harmony in the absence of the Avatar, lest those who seek to upset balance seize the oppurtunity presented while the world is without its defender.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.005.OPTA;Surely a great loss;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.005.OPTB;Farewell, old friend;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.005.OPTC;Good riddance;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.006.T;The Avatar Lives!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.006.D1;The Sages have announced the identity of the Avatar! Rather unfortunately, the Avatar's people have been rendered almost entirely extinct - although they have an intrinsic command over their element, and can rely on their past lives for aid, it will take them much time and effort to be able to master their element and gain the knowledge of a new one. The world can only wait with bated breath to see if this Avatar will be able to restore balance...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.006.D2;The Sages have announced the identity of the Avatar! As surely as the dawn does the coming of a new Avatar hail the coming of a bright new era.\n\nIt is a time of much rejoicing for all four nations, as the link between the human and spirit worlds walks among them once again. All that remains is to see whether this Avatar's incarnation will be overseeing a time of peace, or one of strife...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.006.OPTA;And to think, in my court all along!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.006.OPTB;And to my dynasty!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.006.OPTC;They're interesting times we live in...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.006.OPTD;I have a great duty ahead of me;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.008.T;Avatar Killer;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.008.D;The Avatar lies dead, and it was known to be by my hand. The Sages have cursed my name, as do many who looked to the Avatar as the guardian of balance. This kind of recognition ensures that my name will live forever, for better or for worse, and that even my descendents will be forever associated with this action.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.008.OPTA;What have I done?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.008.OPTB;No greater foe could ever be felled!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.008.OPTC;This is unforgiveable...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.008.OPTD;Only one thing will spare my family the shame!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.010.D;The Sages have bought a young boy to court today. He shows promise as a skilled firebender, and a penchant for theological studies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.010.OPTA;A fine addition to my court;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.011.T;Roku Declared Avatar!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.011.D;The Sages have declared a new Avatar: Roku, of the Fire Nation. As spring must flow into summer, so too must the cycle of the Avatar continue from Earth to Fire. As celebrations are held all across the world, Roku will have to settle into his new role as Avatar, bridge between humanity and the spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.011.OPTA;I've got big shoes to fill!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.011.OPTB;May he be a suitable successor to Kyoshi!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.012.D;One of my students has shown an exceptional aptitude for airbending. Playful and good-hearted, this boy could go on to achieve great things.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.012.OPTA;An excellent addition to my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.013.T;Aang declared Avatar!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.013.D;The Gurus have declared a new Avatar: Aang, of the Air Nomads! As summer flows into autumn, so too must the cycle of the Avatar continue from Fire to Air. As celebrations are being held all across the world, Aang will have to settle into his new role as Avatar, bridge between humanity and the spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.013.OPTA;This seems like a lot of responsibility...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.013.OPTB;May he be a suitable successor to Roku!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.014.D;Rather unexpectedly, an infant has found her way to court. Going by Korra, her parents seem absent for one reason or another. Ordinarily this wouldn't be noteworthy, but the girl seems beyond healthy. Perhaps she'll make a good soldier?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.014.OPTA;Hopefully she'll develop into a good bender.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.015.D;The other kids keep trying to go first, take my toys, and push me around! When I start bending another element, that shuts them up!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.015.OPTA;I'm the Avatar! They gotta deal with it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.016.D;Young Korra is bending another element!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.016.OPTA;Well, that's the Avatar for you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.017.T;Korra declared Avatar!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.017.D;While those close to her have known for a long time, the rest of the world is now aware that Korra is the Avatar! Already commanding control of all 4 elements, Korra needs only to truly master her abilities to realise her full potential. The world waits with bated breath to see what this prodigy of an Avatar can achieve!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.017.OPTA;Time to show everyone what I can do!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.017.OPTB;May she be a suitable successor to Aang!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

NAE.10X.D;Through hard work and study, I've mastered another element.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.10X.OPTA;My journey continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.105.D;It's taken many trials and tribulations, but I finally understand what it means to be Avatar. There is a me, but no self. I will live forever, and I will die. Each and every creature is connected with me, and each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.105.OPTA;I am [Root.GetDynName]. I am the Avatar.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.106.T;An Unworthy Avatar;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.106.D;Like the wretched lout Avatar Kuruk, [Root.GetBestName] has, by action or inaction, failed in their duties as Avatar! Everyone from Sages and lords down to the lowliest of peasants spit on their name and scorn their failure to protect the world and maintain the balance. All that can be hoped for now is that this accursed incarnation will be mercifully short, and the next Avatar in the cycle will do better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.106.OPTA;A pox upon them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.106.OPTB;Most inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.107.DL;Though nothing would bring me more joy than being by your side, my duties as Avatar must come first. Perhaps there will come a day where we can settle down together, but it is not this day. I hope you understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.107.D;To [Root.GetBestName],\n\nBy the time you read this, I will already be gone.\nMaybe the common [Root.GetManWomanOpp] of your realm can be bought into your bed so easily, but not I. As the Avatar, I refuse this indignation, and will be taking my leave post-haste.\n\n - [the_avatar.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.107.OPTA;One doesn't refuse the Avatar...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.108.D;I'm not sure quite what I expected when I ordered the Avatar bought to my bedchamber like any other prize. Now I have two unconscious guards, a missing bedroom wall, and I'm much less of the [Root.GetManWoman] I once was. Nor am I certain if the fact I still draw breath is a mercy or a cruelty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.108.OPTA;How could they?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.111.D1;Contemplating my predicament in my cell, a pair of keys drop at my feet. Two of my friends peer in through the bars above! "Well, come on then! You wouldn't believe what we had to do to get those!"\nThe next few minutes are a daring escape, and by the end of it I'm being carried by my grateful team mates away from that prison. Sore - but free!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.111.D2;Keeping a bender imprisoned is no easy feat - let alone one with command over multiple elements! After biding my time for the exact right moment, I enact my cunning and brilliant plan for an escape - and it works! The yells of my former jailer echo into the night as I make my get away.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.111.OPTA;Sweet freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.112.D;My troops are reporting that the Avatar has escaped imprisonment! Is there no prison secure enough for them?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.112,OPTA;Damn it all!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.114.D;You are no Avatar! You meddle with forces far beyond your understanding, interloper - and you WILL be punished for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.114.OPTA;Your life is forefeit!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.114.TT;The world can only support proper Avatars. Let this be a lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.115.D;[Root.Religion.GetNameCap] professes a belief against the balance of the world, and against my existence and duties as the Avatar specifically. Can I really continue to believe in something so hostile to my very nature?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.115.OPTA;It's time to seek new understanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.115.OPTB;I should follow the example of prior Avatars;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.115.OPTC;I stand by my beliefs!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.115.TT;There will be dire consequences...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

NAE.201.D;[Root.GetFOA], [Root.GetBestName],\n\nWarfare sews blood and strife across the land. The misery it causes is affecting even the spirits. Regardless of the justness of your cause, as the Avatar I must implore you: lay down your arms to allow both worlds to heal.\n\n - [the_avatar.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.201.OPTA;The Avatar speaks, and I listen;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.201.OPTB;I rule in my realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.202.D;[Root.GetFOA], [Root.GetBestName],\n\nThere are those in your realm who threaten to upset the natural order, by honouring the spirits in strange and heretical ways. If you would allow me, I would educate them back onto the true path.\n\n - [the_avatar.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.203.D;[Root.GetFOA], [Root.GetBestName],\n\nYour realm's raider problem hasn't gone unnoticed. As you don't engage in this deplorable act yourself, I feel honour-bound to help you. Please, allow me and my warriors to bolster your own.\n\n - [the_avatar.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.205.D;[Root.GetFOA], [Root.GetBestName],\n\nWord has reached me of a conspiracy against you. As a fair and virtuous ruler, I offer you the best protection I can muster. Your death would surely upset the balance of the worlds.\n\n - [the_avatar.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.206.D;[Root.GetFOA], [Root.GetBestName],\n\nThe civil war of your realm is spreading strife and fear as it continues to rage on. As the Avatar, I have a duty to intervene - for everyone's sake.\n\n - [the_avatar.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.206.OPTA;They would dare join my enemy?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.206.OPTB;I dare not refuse these peace terms...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.207.D;[Root.GetFOA], [Root.GetBestName],\n\nThe rebellion your lands are plagued by are a cause for concern. This upset of the natural order cannot stand - as the Avatar, I'm forced to interefere. May this war be brief, but decisive.\n\n - [the_avatar.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.207.OPTA;They dare join my enemy?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.207.OPTB;I dare not refuse these peace terms...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.208.D;[Root.GetFOA], [Root.GetBestName],\n\nYour cause is righteous! The tyrant you once called liege must be overthrown. Those loyal to my cause stand ready to serve.\nMay this war be brief and decisive.\n\n - [the_avatar.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.209.D1;Hello, [Root.GetBestName].\n\nMy name is [the_avatar.GetFirstName], and I'm the Avatar. I'm here to help you by ruling your realm for a little while, and to keep you safe until you're more grown up. Nobody will hurt you or your people, as long as I'm here. Is that okay?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.209.D2;Hello, [Root.GetFirstName]. As a young [Root.GetTitle], there are lots of people who might hurt you. If you'd like, I can look after you until you grow up, and help you if another ruler tries to hurt you. As the Avatar, I'd be honour-bound to protect you. Is that okay?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.210.D;Explosions and earth crashing into earth ricochet through my gardens. A harried guard bursts into my court to inform me that we're under attack - and is promptly silenced by a water whip. The Avatar, along with their merry band of friends, have come for my head.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.210.OPTA;Only one of us will live come sunrise;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.210.OPTB;Their friends are weaker. Fight them, and escape!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.210.OPTC;Guards, cover my escape!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.211.D;Your cowardly target has fled! Their loyal guards stand no chance against your team. While fire engulfs another building, you're forced to retreat for now - with your target weakened, but far from dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.211.DD;Within the palace of your target, fire burning all around and your team keeping anyone from interfering, you face them down. They rise from their seat, and throw their finery to the side, adopting a fighting stance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.211.DF;The inital assault goes well, but your target gives you the slip. Only the sound of clashing weapons and bending arts clues you on on what's happened - one of your team has engaged your target, alone, in an attempt to stop them escaping.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.211.OPTA;They'll die with a little honour;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.211.OPTB;I can only hope their duel went well...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.211.OPTC;I'll chase you to the ends of the Earth!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.212.D;[Root.GetFOA], [Root.GetBestName],\n\nThe economy of your realm is in shambles. Like Avatar Szeto before me, I'd like to assist in ensuring that this downturn doesn't disadvantage one nation over the other, or spread undue misery among your populace.\n\n - [the_avatar.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.213.D;Court was livened up today by the unexpected arrival of the Avatar. They demonstrated some bending techniques and shared wisdom with child and adult alike, before bowing to me. "I'd be happy to instruct your people further, if you'd allow me to stay.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.214.D;To the esteemed [Root.GetBestName],\n\nIn light of your good and virtuous rule, let it be known across all the world that you have my endorsement. Walk always in wisdom.\n\n - [the_avatar.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.215.D;To the despicable [Root.GetBestName],\n\nIn light of your ignoble rule, let it be known across all the world that you have earned my condemnation.\nMay wisdom return to you, or else hasten your end.\n\n - [the_avatar.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.215.OPTA;Damn them!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.216.D;[Root.GetFOA], [Root.GetBestName],\n\nMy duties as Avatar have bought me to your realm, to address problems with spirits and humans alike. If you would allow me, I would cleanse your realm of disharmony - and remain with your court for a time. I would be yours to command in exchange for your hospitality.\n\n - [the_avatar.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.216.TT;All §Rnegative §Yprovince modifiers§! will be removed from your realm. Some §Gpositive §Ymodifiers§! may be added to your provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.218.D;[Root.GetFOA], [Root.GetBestName],\n\nIn light of your recent troubles, I'd like to dispatch a cadre of soldiers to your realm, to assist with defeating your enemies. Fight well, that the strife of war lasts as short a time as possible.\n\n - [the_avatar.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.219;To the [GetFromRootCompliment], [Root.GetBestName],\n\nAs the Avatar, I seek to master all four elements, and would be grateful if I would be allowed to remain in your court to seek the tutelage of your benders. I would be yours to command for the duration of my stay, in exchange for your hospitality.\n\n - [the_avatar.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.219.OPTA;You will be an honoured guest, Avatar;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.219.OPTB;There will be no charity, seek out another liege;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.221.D;I made a vow to the Avatar that I wouldn't pursue offensive wars. Can I really go back on my word?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.221.OPTA;Of course I can!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.221.OPTB;War? No, it must have been... miscommunication...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.222.D;Word reached me today of a slave uprising in one of my counties. Judging by the scale of destruction, this can only have been the work of the Avatar!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.226.D;At the hands of the Avatar's machinations, the realm has been plunged into chaos! Peasants revolt against my rule, my supply lines are disrupted, even the spirits themselves seem to conspire to bring me bad fortune.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.226.OPTA;Damn it all, enact martial law!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.226.OPTB;Let the peasants revolt, we have other problems;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.228.D;I stand poised to use my full power to free people from bondage. There will be damage, even deaths, but people will be free. All that remains it to enter the Avatar State.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PLAYER_AVATAR_SUPERHERO_HEALTH_TT;The use of your Fully Realised power will take a toll on your health...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.228.OPTA;I'm ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.228.TT;This will free the county from slaver control, putting a new count in charge as your tributary.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.228.OPTB;Perhaps the time isn't right...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

NAE.302.D;[Root.GetFOA], [Root.GetBestName],\n\nThank you for your hospitality, but my duties as Avatar take me elsewhere. Walk always in wisdom.\n\n - [the_avatar.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.303.D;My duties as [Root.GetTitle] mean I can't travel with the Avatar anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.303.OPTA;I'll always have the memories.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.304.D;[avatar_candidate.GetFirstName] has told me that [avatar_candidate.GetSheHe] wishes to leave my court to serve under the Avatar. While it's certain to be a valuable experience for them, it isn't without risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.304.OPTA;Go with my blessing;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.304.OPTB;I need you here, [avatar_candidate.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.305.D;An enthused noble[avatar_candidate.GetManWoman] arrived today, bearing a letter of reccomendation from their liege, [From.GetTitledName]. It seems they wish to sign on as one of my companions for a time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.305.OPTA;I'm happy to have you, [avatar_candidate.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.305.OPTB;This isn't who I'm looking for;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.306.D;I've recieved your promising candidate, and they've already settled in. Thank you for permitting them here - I'll see to it they're cared for to the best of my ability.\n\n - [the_avatar.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.307.D;Whilst I appreciate the enthusiasm [avatar_candidate.GetFirstName] displays, but they aren't what I'm looking for in a companion. I hope you understand.\n\n - [the_avatar.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.307.OPTA;I hope [avatar_candidate.GetFirstName] isn't upset...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.312.D;A group of benders are gathered in my courtyard, being taught by a figure I vaguely recognise. [FromFrom.GetSheHe] looks up, and smiles. "Hello, my [Root.GetLordLady]."\n\nIt's [FromFrom.GetBestName], back from travelling with the Avatar! They regale me and the audience with stories - and demonstrate the new bending techniques they've picked up on their travels!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.312.OPT;What a spectacular experience they've had!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.313;A group of soldiers are gathered in my courtyard, being taught by a figure I vaguely recognise. [FromFrom.GetSheHe] looks up, and smiles. "Hello, my [Root.GetLordLady]."\n\nIt's [FromFrom.GetBestName], back from travelling with the Avatar! They regale me and the audience with stories - and demonstrate the new fighting techniques they've picked up on their travels!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.313.OPT;What a spectacular experience they've had!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.315.D;My duties are interrupted the sound of music. Outside my window is an enormous host throwing coins to the people and displaying a coterie of exotic animals. The leader locks eyes with me, and grins. It's [FromFrom.GetBestName], back from travelling with the Avatar - loaded with stories and spoils, it seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.315.OPT;And some are even shared with the realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.316.D;I'm awoken in the night - an important visitor has arrived. Grumbling, I make my way to the courtroom - and find the Avatar stood there. "[Root.GetDynName]? I thought it best I come tell you in person. It's about [FromFrom.GetBestName]..."\n\nThe rest of what they say barely registers. I grow cold with every word, and tears fall, unbidden, from my face.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.316.OPT;[FromFrom.GetSheHe]'s really gone, isn't [FromFrom.GetSheHe]?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.317.D;I'm initially suspect of the crippled beggar who entered my court - but it was [FromFrom.GetBestName], back from their travels with the Avatar! And apparently a little worse for wear. "Bah, just a scratch." they say, laughing - but there's sadness in their eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.317.OPT;I'm just glad to have you home in one piece!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.318.D;All the court is abuzz with the news of [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s return - and the harsh words and apologies they dole out. Despite the journey they must have had, they seem reluctant to talk about it. When a servant drops a plate, they flinch, and wince as if in pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.318.OPT;Something isn't right...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.319.D;When an imposing figure steps into court, I prepare for a fight - but it's [FromFrom.GetBestName], back from their travels with the Avatar! They greet me with a smile, and a handshake that nearly hurts. They weren't this muscular when they left!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.319.OPT;They're a prime physical specimen now!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.320.D;I'm handing down a judgement when I'm suddenly quite lost for words - how best to put it? A voice interjects with the perfect phrasing. It's [FromFrom.GetBestName], back from their travels with the Avatar! They seem... different, somehow. They have a smile like they know something I don't.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.320.OPT;They must've learned something out there.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.321.D;My council haven't bothered me for some time now. Growing curious as to this sudden increase in competence, I go to check on them - only to find them gathered around [FromFrom.GetBestName], back from their travels with the Avatar! [FromFrom.GetSheHe] greets me with a smile, and continues [FromFrom.GetHerHis] lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.321.OPT;They weren't this knowledgeable when they left, were they?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.322.D;I'm expecting [FromFrom.GetBestName] back from their travels with the Avatar. When they arrive, it's on time and filled with stories, as one might imagine - what I don't expect is the companion on their arm!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.322.OPT;I hope they make a good pair;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.331.D;While others mourn the Avatar, I mourn [From.GetDynName]. While they might not always have been there, the thought of no longer having them at all brings a swelling of emotions to the surface.\n\nThe time comes for my final words. Now that their body is still and unmoving, I can say to them what I never could in life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.331.OPTA;I didn't know you. I can't judge you;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.331.OPTB;The world needed you. Without you, it's up to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.331.OPTC;I needed you! I didn't need the Avatar, I needed YOU!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.331.TT;You let go of the pain from their absence in your life, and grieve.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.332.D;Sometimes I hear about the Avatar's exploits, and wonder why they're doing that instead of being here with me. Is there really so much happening to keep them away?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.332.OPTA;I'm sure they'll be back soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.332.OPTB;Maybe they hate me;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.332.OPTC;Screw them! Who do they think they are, abandoning me?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.332.OPTD;Guess the Avatar isn't all they're cracked up to be;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.333.D;Sometimes I read about the Avatar's exploits, and think back to when they were young. Before all the danger and the travel, being out there saving the world. It's in a parent's nature to worry - I wish I could hold them in my arms again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.333.OPTA;I'm never going to stop worrying;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.333.OPTB;I'm sure they're doing fine;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.334.D;Through the rain of the night, soaked, wearing a tired smile, comes a visitor. I can scarcely believe my eyes. It's [Root.the_avatar.GetFirstName]. They seem so different now. In my head they're still just a happy, smiling baby [Root.the_avatar.GetBoyGirl]. Now their eyes are a little wearier, their shoulders a little heavier. All the memories come flooding back when I'm pulled into a hug. Under it all, despite everything... they're still my [Root.the_avatar.GetSonDaughter]. I still love them. No amount of time, no duties of the Avatar, will ever change that.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.334.OPTA;I will never, ever stop being proud of them;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.334.OPTB;They'll always have a home here;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.334.OPTC;Make them dinner. Let them be normal tonight;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.334.OPTD;It feels like they're always slipping away... but they're here;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.335.D;The moments that [Root.the_avatar.GetFirstName] and I have together are few, but all the more precious because of it. A small break from their Avatar duties leaves them able to spend the weekend with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.335.OPTA;They come, they go, but love remains;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.336.D;A large gathering of peasants outside my walls is normally cause for concern, but these peasants are bearing gifts! "For one who bears the Avatar’s blood", according to one poem attached to a silver jewellery box.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.336.OPTA;I can't accept these;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.336.OPTB;I'm touched by the generosity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.336.OPTC;Is that all?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

NAE.402.D;To the [GetFromRootCompliment], [Root.GetBestName],\n\nI'd be happy to settle down as your vassal. Is there a particular parcel of land you'd like to offer me?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.402.OPTA;How about this?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.402.OPTB;Or this one?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.402.OPTC;Perhaps this would do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.402.OPTD;I've changed my mind;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.403.D;Regretfully, my duties as Avatar require that I leave your service. May my replacement over your lands govern well. Farewell for now.\n\n - [the_avatar.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.403.OPTA;I can't exactly stop them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.404.D;To the [GetFromRootInsult], [Root.GetBestName],\n\nI will abide your vile rule no longer! I demand that you release me from your vassalage, effective immediately.\n\n - [the_avatar.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.404.OPTA;Very well. Goodbye, Avatar.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.404.OPTB;Over my dead body!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.405.D;My [Root.Heir.GetSonDaughter], [Root.Heir.GetFirstName], is an adult now. They're more than capable of ruling over my lands. As the Avatar, there's so much more to the world than my realm, and many who need my help. Perhaps now that they've grown up, it might be time to leave my family to wander again?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.405.OPTA;Yes, my duty calls;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.405.OPTB;I'm quite happy to keep being a ruler;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.406.D;A contingent of peasants, warriors and other devotees has arrived, pledging their service to help me in this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.406.OPTA;Welcome aboard!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.406.OPTB;This isn't your fight;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.408.D;My duties as a ruler and an Avatar leave me with an inner circle I work with more often than others. After a particularly busy week, I've found that I've...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.408.OPTA;... come to rely on a friend;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.408.OPTB;... grown closer to someone on my team;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.408.OPTC;... rekindled an old friendship;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.408.OPTD;... developed feelings for someone;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.409.T;The Fate of the Avatar;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.409.D;After much time wandering and learning, the Avatar has taken up permanent residence, ruling over a small duchy. Their intereference in the world will likely change, if not diminish.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.409.OPTA;Good for them;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.409.OPTB;I wonder what they'll get up to...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

NAE.501.D;The Avatar has put an end to [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s wars!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.502.D;The Avatar has purged [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s realm of heresy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.503.D;The Avatar has helped [From.GetTitledFirstName] fight raiders!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.504.D;The Avatar is guarding [From.GetTitledFirstName] against a plot.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.505.D;The Avatar has joined a revolt against [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.506.D;The Avatar has taken the young [From.GetTitledFirstName] under their wing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.507.D;The Avatar is helping deal with [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s economic crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.508.D;The Avatar has tutored [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.509.D;The Avatar has bought harmony to [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.510.D;The Avatar has freed a county from the vile grip of slavers!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.515.D;The Avatar has sabotaged [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.516.D;The Avatar has withdrawn from the world, neglecting their duties.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.517,D;The Avatar has exited withdrawal, performing their duties once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.551.D;Thank you for your assistance, Avatar! We're happy to have your help.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.552.D;I firmly reject your offer of aid. Don't meddle in that which does not concern you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

NAE.601.T;The Weight of the Past;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.601.D;As the Avatar, I've a connection to every Avatar who has lived before me. My strongest connection is that to my most immediate predecessor. Should I cultivate this connection?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.601.OPTA;It's part of being the Avatar;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.601.TT1;There will be additional effects;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.601.OPTB;I refuse to be anyone except me;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.601.TT2;There will be NO consequences;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.602.D;The struggles in my life are myriad. While meditating, my predecessor gave me an anecdote from their own life. Perhaps being more like them is the key?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.602.OPTA;I'll do as they did;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.602.OPTB;I'll seek council from all past Avatars;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.603.D;The cold of death's embrace is not pleasant. And yet I have felt it before - at the hands of another. My predecessor was killed - I was killed. And I remember the face of the one who did it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.603.OPTA;They'll pay for this;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.603.OPTB;Their entire FAMILY will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.603.TT;This will start a dynastic feud;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.603.OPTC;I'm a different person, I can forgive;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.604.D;There are many spirits that people venerate, and philosophies they live their lives by. I, too, have lived differently in my past lives. My most recent reincarnation has much to teach me about their faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.604.OPTA;And I have much to learn;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.604.OPTB;I don't want to hear such heresy;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.605.D;I keep getting memories of a mother and father who aren't mine. Of an entire family who weren't my own, but who I loved and who loved me nonetheless. They must be the previous Avatar's.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.605.OPTA;I should go and see them;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.605.OPTB;There are many families I will never know;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.605.OPTC;At least I still have my family;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.606.D;An unexpected visitor has arrived today. The Avatar. Not the Avatar as I knew them, but the new one. They've come to see me, driven by memories they had of their past life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.606.OPTA;Don't let them in;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.606.OPTB;I welcome them in;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.607.D;I'm welcomed graciously into my old family's home. They treat me like I belong there - full of warmth and acceptance. Every anecdote triggers a feeling in me, familiar yet distant. Their smiles still make me happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.607.OPTA;And yet, they're still strangers to me...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.607.OPTB;It's as if I still know them;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.607.OPTC;I wish they were my family;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.607.OPTD;We should travel together!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.608.D;The new Avatar isn't the person I knew. But just occasionally, I feel like I see them both. In a shared anecdote, or a echo in their laughter. Something about seeing them happy still makes me happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.608.OPTA;But they're still a stranger to me;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.608.OPTB;I could spend more time with them;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.608.OPTC;They were kind of cute...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.609.D;Reading about the past Avatar's exploits, I recognise some of the names. Like they were in a dream, ringing a bell in my memory. Feelings of excitement, safety, and joy spark up in me - these were my friends, once.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.609.OPTA;I should go and see them!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.609.OPTB;How many adventures did I miss?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.609.OPTC;Ah, so that's why I was like that...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.610.D;An unexpected visitor has arrived today. The Avatar. Not the Avatar as I knew them, but the new one. They've come to see me, driven by memories they had of their past life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.610.OPTA;Don't let them in;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.610.OPB;I welcome them in;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.611.D;Don't ask what happened to event 611. We don't talk about 611.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.612.D;I'm welcomed graciously into my old friend's home. They treat me like I belong there - cracking jokes and sharing stories. I feel like I can share anything with them - that if danger appeared, right now, they'd defend me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.612.OPTA;And yet they never came to find me? Some friends they are;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.612.OPTB;I still feel like I know them;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.612.OPTC;They're kind of cute...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.612.OPTD;We should travel together!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.613.D;This Avatar isn't my Avatar. They don't remember what we did together, they don't act the same. But something in how they carry themselves, an echo in their laughter... it's impossible not to feel something.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.613.OPTA;This person is a stranger to me;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.613.OPTB;There's still a friendship here;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.613.OPTC;I know EXACTLY what I feel!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.614.D;While wandering my lands one evening, I find a strange light through the trees. Following it leads me to a resting animal, watching me approach. There's an intellect behind its eyes - like it's been waiting for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.614.OPTA;I shall adopt it - Avatars have companions!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.614.OPTB;Maybe a more traditional pet...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.614.OPTC;Dinner is served!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.620.D;For the third time today, I've called a courtier by the wrong name. Not of anybody I know, either - it just feels correct to me, like an instinct.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.620.OPTA;Maybe it was somebody I knew in a past life?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.620.OPTB;Everyone makes mistakes. Apologise and move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.621.D;Taking a walk through the grounds, I found myself suddenly sat in my bedroom, staring at the ceiling. I've absolutely no recollection of how I got here - nor of it becoming sunset. Trying to remember only draws me back to somewhere I've never been, but recognise - with people I've never known, who call me by a name that isn't mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.621.OPTA;I need to see the physician.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.621.TT;Some draughts and spiritual exercises should keep you centred on the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.621.OPTB;I should consult the other Avatars.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.621.TT2;You hold a communion with your past lives to find answers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.621.OPTC;I'm sure it's fine. There's so much to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.622.D;One of my predecessors, Yangchen, tells me this is similar to something she suffered from while she was Avatar. A powerful connection to the spirit world means another prior Avatar, one much older than anyone I can reach, is forcing their own experiences onto mine, intentionally or otherwise. If I don't learn to master the Avatar state, to be in complete control of all my lives, my past and present might bleed together so much they become inseperable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.622.OPTA;I'll dedicate myself to this task.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.622.TT;Living a pious life will help in mastering your Avatar state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.622.OPTB;Let's hope I master it in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.623.D;One moment I'm writing my correspondance, and the next I'm standing somewhere far from here. The feelings are overwhelming - rage, sadness, betrayal. I'm almost an observer to my own actions, using my powers as Avatar to stop a great wave crashing into the city. Or... is it a volcano? An earthquake? All of these things?\n\nWhen I am myself again, the room is absolutely wrecked, with signs of damage from advanced bending. And there's blood on the floor. Blood from my nose.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.623.OPTA;This has to stop. Now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.623.OPTB;I must be very in touch with one of my past lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.623.TT;You subject yourself to a strict regime to learn to control these episodes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.624.D;My unwilling 'visits' to the past have become ever more frequent. Entire sessions of court are no longer mine - my advisors speak of conversations I've never had, people's faces seem to shift between those close to me now and those close to whoever I was back then. The past and the present are starting to blend together. My thoughts speak in a different tone, and I can't tell which feelings are mine and which are forced upon me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.624.OPTA;No! No more! I am in control here!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.624.TT;You may not get better, but you'll at least be in control of your episodes - or you'll lose your grip on reality altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.624.OPTB;These episodes will plague me no more. I am in control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.624.OPTC;I just want to rest. If someone wants my time, take it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.625.D;My time seems split completely now. I've stopped keeping track of who I am. When I am. Sometimes I'm the [Root.GetTitle], sometimes I'm a wanderer. I recognise fashions from centuries ago, I speak in dialects nobody recognises anymore. Occasionally I break down into laughter or tears, the feelings like waves crashing against the shore, receeding as quickly as they came. I don't remember why. I never will. This is who I was. Who I am. Who I always will be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.625.OPTA;I hope my successor does not suffer this affliction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.625.OPTB;I'm not fit to rule anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.625.OPTC;There is only one option left to me...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.625.TT;When you are next yourself, you will attempt to end this reincarnation by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

NAE.701.T;The Crisis War;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.701.D;For as long as there has been an Avatar, they have been sworn to defend the world from anything that would upset the balance and harmony so crucial to it. [Root.GetTitledName] represents a threat to that balance.\n\n[Root.the_avatar.GetBestName] has called a state of crisis, and has begun amassing volunteers and allies who would challenge this threat directly. In 2 years, the future of all four nations will be decided on the field of battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.701.OPTA;The world waits with bated breath;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.701.OPTB;I should join when the time comes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.701.TT;When the war is declared, you'll have a chance to pick a side. Be ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.701.OPTC;I better prepare...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.702.D;A cadre of volunteers has amassed at my court. They're mostly made up of veterans of past campaigns, led by an accomplished commander - all pledging to do what they can for the upcoming Crisis War.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.702.OPTA;I'm honoured for the help;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.702.OPTB;My regular forces will be sufficient;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.703.D1;A group of volunteers have arrived to help with the upcoming Crisis War. Though they're also happy to help with the war I'm currently in, I should remember not to wear down my forces in other conflicts!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.703.D2;Every day, more and more people from all nations rally to my banner and pledge their service in the upcoming Crisis War. What kind of volunteers have arrived today?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.703.OPTA;A cadre of troops;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.703.OPTB;Sailors, with ships to boot;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.703.OPTC;An accomplished general;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.703.OPTD;Civilians, and their well-wishes;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.705.T;War Were Declared;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.705.D;The preparations are finished. The armies of [Root.the_avatar.GetBestName] march on [Root.crisis_defender.GetBestName]'s realm, intent on putting an end to their realm once and for all. The future of all four nations hangs in the balance!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.705.OPTA;I will assist the Avatar!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.705.OPTB;I'll observe with great interest;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.705.TT;You can always change your mind later by joining the war using the normal diplomacy interaction;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.705.OPTC;I will oppose the Avatar!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.705.OPTD;Bring it on!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.705.OPTE;Balance must be restored!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.707.T;Victory for the Avatar!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.707.D;The efforts of [Root.the_avatar.GetBestName] and their allies have borne fruit! By strength of will, shrewd manoeuvring, or the grace of the spirits, [Root.crisis_defender.GetTitledName]’s defences have been overrun and their armies set to rout - while they themselves were slain by the Avatar.\n\nThose who were once oppressed have been freed, and the entire realm torn asunder to finally end the machinations of those who would upset the balance of the world. Celebrations are erupting across all four nations, toasting to the victory of the forces of order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.707.OPTA;Balance once again reigns...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.708.T;Defeat for the Avatar!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.708.D;Disaster for the Avatar! Though they fought valiantly, [Root.the_avatar.GetTitledName] and [Root.the_avatar.GetHerHis] forces have been crushed - and [Root.the_avatar.GetSheHe] bears a permanent scar of their failure.\n\nEven the combined forces of the world cannot stop [Root.crisis_defender.GetTitledName]. If this great effort failed, what hope is there for their foes?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.708.OPTA;A new order of the world is dawning...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

NAE.902.DG;Two of my subjects come to me, requesting my permission to have them wed. Being of the same sex, there is no dynastic or political angle to the union, only love.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.902.D;Two of my courtiers have come before me to ask for my blessing to have them wed. The couple seem happy together, though as their liege my permission is still required.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.902.OPTA;Of course I approve!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.902.OPTB;I cannot permit it at this time;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.903.D;You are a shining star in my life. If you would have me, I would be yours, from now until forever. Will you marry me?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.903.OPTA;I'd love nothing more;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAE.903.OPTB;I'm sorry, but my dynastic duties come first;;;;;;;;;;;;x
